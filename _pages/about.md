Hi, I’m Bartu Uzun. I’m an incoming MSc student in Media & Communications (Research) at the London School of Economics. I recently completed my undergraduate studies at Koç University, where I studied Computer Engineering alongside Media and Visual Arts.

Broadly, I’m interested in platform governance, politics of data and algorithms, and how emerging technologies reorganize labor, knowledge, and public life. My long-term goal is to pursue a PhD and an academic career researching the social and institutional dimensions of these sociotechnical systems.

Alongside my academic work, I have experience building software systems, including B2B projects and B2C mobile apps.
